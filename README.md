# Erkennung-von-Android-Malware-mithilfe-von-Maschinellem-Lernen
In this study, a machine learning based system was developed to analyze the APK of the given app and extract the corresponding opcode values after converting the opcode values to count vector format and extracting the appâ€™s permissions, and then using Machine- Learning and deep learning models to select and determine whether the application is malicious or benign and what type of malicious software it is. We determine the success rate of malware detection (F1, Precision, Recall, Accuracy, etc..). Experiments and results will be explained in detail in the following sections. 4
